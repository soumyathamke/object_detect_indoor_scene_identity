üõ°Ô∏è Object Detection App for Your Safety

This project is a two-part solution:

YOLOv5-based model training and object detection using Google Colab.
Streamlit web application for image capture and interactive display.

It helps users detect objects in real time through a webcam or uploaded photo using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model.
